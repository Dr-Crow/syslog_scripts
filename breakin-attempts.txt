This email came from syslog.it.marist.edu
It is scanning /data/rsyslog/messages and alerts every 100
times it sees an "Invalid user" line in the file and
will wait 60 minutes before sending another alert.

This program sends email between 6:00 and 18:00
This program is restarted by logwatch so a carefully timed
attack may not send a notification email.
